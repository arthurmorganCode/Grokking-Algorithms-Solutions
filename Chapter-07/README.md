Chapter 7: Dijkstra's Algorithm
Summary
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. This chapter explains the algorithm and its application in finding the shortest path.

Key Concepts
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Priority queues
Graphs with weighted edges
Time complexity: O(V^2) or O(E + V log V) with priority queue
